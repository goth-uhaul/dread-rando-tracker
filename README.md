### Major Items

Left-click on an item to toggle between obtained and not obtained. For progressive items, left-click to increase the progression by one, or right-click to decrease it by one.

If you get a hint from a Network Station, left-click in the top-left corner to cycle through ZDR's major areas to reflect where the hint said the item was. (You can cycle in reverse by clicking the right mouse button instead.) Alternatively, hover over the item and press the keyboard key associated with the first letter of the area name (e.g. <kbd>A</kbd> for Artaria or <kbd>G</kbd> for Ghavoran).

If you get a Speed Booster or Flash Shift upgrade, left-click in the bottom-right corner to increment your upgrade count (right-click to decrement it).

### Major Bosses

Left-click on a boss to toggle between active and defeated. Right-click on a boss to assign it a DNA.
